<h1>Welcome to Lost Gehenna!</h1>

<i>This is meant to be a mostly roleplay dungeon crawler set in a unexplored southern american inspired jungle with the focus on character stories of triumths, defeats and worse.</i><br>
<i>We have a unique combat, ballistic, and medical system. Currently we're running on regular SS13 code but are working on making the game different overall.</i><br>
<i>Have fun or suffer an unfortunate fate. Oh and try to fit the atmosphere, cheers</i><br>
